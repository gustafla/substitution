# Week 2 Report

## 2022-03-24, 1h

I added a little bit of comments and read the
[rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustdoc/) book.

I added more comments and lots of tests. Next I want to move "under the hood"
code into a library crate (lib.rs file) so that I can start documenting and
building the business logic better, separate of the CLI.

Also repository documentation, README and cargo & rustdoc usage instructions
need improvement.
