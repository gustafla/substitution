# Week 4 Report

## 2022-04-09, 7h

This week I have been tired and found myself concentrating on irrelevant
tasks/hobbies too much.

One of them was relevant to this course:
[a DFS for a certain square grid graph problem](https://github.com/gustafla/cities)

I ended up in several deadline crunches for multiple different courses
including this project course.

However, today I managed to finish my CLI and implement a trie which I believe
to be quite performant as it uses const size nodes and a flat vector/array
instead of pointers. No benchmarks yet and the API is not fully fledged
out yet as it requires cloning the key instead of just working with references.

Next week my goal is to load up a dictionary in the trie, and then implement
the data structures needed for searching for the correct key. I hope the
square grid graph DFS I voluntarily wrote earlier will guide me with that.
