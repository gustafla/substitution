# Week 3 Report

## 2022-04-02, 6h

Greetings from Winter Assembly! This week has mostly slipped by as I have
been busy with other courses and buiding a new home server PC. Now, on the
last day before deadline, I refactored the business logic into it's own library
crate (lib.rs), added support for reading from files/stdin, fixed all the linter
warnings, wrote more documentation, and currently am writing this weekly log as
well.

Next week I want to start focusing on the main goal of the project, that is
getting a brute force backtracking decipher going for the English language.
