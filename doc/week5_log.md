I spent a surprisingly long time adding a few tests to my trie and refactoring
it's API. I also implemented dictionary file loading into `decrypt()`.

I did some finishing touches to yesterday's work and wrote this report.

I attended a workshop and implemented some decryption key logic. I don't yet

I tried a recursive approach. I'm thinking of ditching the frequency order
for a simpler brute force.
